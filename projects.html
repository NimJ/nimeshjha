    <section class="projects-section">
    <h2>Infrastructure as a Service Data Platform</h2>
    <p>
        Developed a comprehensive Data Lake for the IaaS Platform Operations Team, facilitating efficient data storage and retrieval. 
        As the Lead Data Scientist, I was solely responsible for designing and deploying the Data Lake on IBM Cloud. 
        I created an end-to-end data pipeline for ingesting and processing data.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, Jupyter Notebook, DataStage, ServiceNow APIs</p>
    <p><strong>Deployment Platform:</strong> IBM Cloud</p>

    <h2>Metric Anomaly Detection</h2>
    <p>
        Built a Metric Anomaly Detection system to identify irregular patterns in system metrics. 
        As the Lead Data Scientist, I led the project and designed the anomaly detection system using Sysdig APIs, implemented it on IBM Cloud.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, SQL, Jupyter Notebook, Sysdig APIs, Grafana</p>
    <p><strong>Deployment Platform:</strong> IBM Cloud</p>

    <h2>WorkForce360 – Jobs Recommendation</h2>
    <p>
        Developed a recommendation engine to suggest internal job matches for IBM employees. 
        As part of a 3-person data science team, I created a model to recommend job roles based on employee CVs, skillsets, job click history, and internal ratings.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, SPSS, GitHub</p>
    <p><strong>Deployment Platform:</strong> IBM Cloud, Airflow</p>

    <h2>Client360 – NLQ to SQL</h2>
    <p>
        Designed a Natural Language to SQL interface to transform user queries into SQL commands. 
        I collaborated with another data scientist to use Watson Assistant to identify user intents and entities from natural language queries, and developed rule-based transformations to generate SQL syntax.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, Watson Assistant, Jupyter Notebooks</p>
    <p><strong>Deployment Platform:</strong> IBM Cloud</p>

    <h2>Individual Cognitive Insights – Best Contact Recommendation</h2>
    <p>
        Developed a recommendation system to identify the best contacts for product sales. 
        As the sole data scientist on the project, I conducted exploratory data analysis, data modeling, and derived a confidence score to recommend the best sales contacts.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, PySpark, R, SPSS</p>
    <p><strong>Deployment Platform:</strong> IBM Cloud</p>

    <h2>Data Deduplication</h2>
    <p>
        Created a data deduplication system to remove duplicate customer records with high accuracy. 
        As the sole data scientist on the project, I designed a record lineage model that achieved more than 85% accuracy in deduplication.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, PySpark, R, SPSS</p>
    <p><strong>Deployment Platform:</strong> Watson Studio Local</p>

    <h2>Software Testing Productivity Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        Developed a predictive model to estimate software testing efforts and improve productivity. 
        As the lead of a two-member team, I identified key variables affecting software testing efforts and served as the primary contact for client communications.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, R, Django</p>
    <p><strong>Deployment Platform:</strong> Exe-based</p>
